\title{Methods for causal inference with interference}
\description{
Interference occurs when the treatment of one unit affects outcomes of other
units. This package provides methods for estimating causal effects in the
presence of interference. Currently it implements the IPW estimators
proposed by \href{http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0962280210386779}{Tchetgen Tchetgen and Vanderweele (2012)}.
and developed further in \href{http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/biom.12184}{Heydrich-Perez et al. (2014)}.
