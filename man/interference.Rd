\usage{
interference(formula, propensity_integrand = "logit_integrand",
  loglihood_integrand = propensity_integrand, allocations, data,
  model_method = "glmer", model_options = list(family = binomial(link =
  "logit")), causal_estimation_method = "ipw",
  causal_estimation_options = list(set_NA_to_0 = TRUE, variance_estimation =
  "robust"), conf.level = 0.95, rescale.factor = 1, runSilent = T, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{The formula used to define the causal model.  Has a minimum
of 4 parts, separated by \code{|} and \code{~} in a specific structure:
\code{outcome | exposure ~ propensity covariates | group}. The order matters,
and the pipes split the data frame into corresponding pieces. The part
separated by \code{~} is passed to the chosen \code{model_method} used to
estimate or fix propensity parameters.}

\item{propensity_integrand}{A function, which may be created by the user,
used to compute the IP weights. This defaults to \code{logit_integrand},
which calculates the product of inverse logits for individuals in a group:
\eqn{\prod_{j = 1}^{n_i} \{r \times h_{ij}(b_i)^{A_{ij}}\}\{1 - r \times
h_{ij}(b_i)^{1 - A_{ij}} \} f_b(b_i; \theta_s)}{prod(r * plogis(X * fixef + b)^A *
(1 - r * plogis(X * fixef+ b))^(1 - A)) *
dnorm(sd = sqrt(ranef))} where \deqn{h_{ij}(b_i) = logit^{-1}
(\mathbf{X}_{ij}\theta_a + b_i)} and \eqn{b_i} is a group-level random effect,
\eqn{f_b} is a \eqn{N(0, \theta_s)} density, and \eqn{r} is a known
randomization probability which may be useful if a participation vector is
included in the \code{formula}. If no random effect was included in the
\code{formula}, \code{logit_integrand} essentially ignores the random effect
and \eqn{f_b(b_i, \theta_s)} integrates to 1. See details for arguments that
can be passed to \code{logit_integrand}}

\item{loglihood_integrand}{A function, which may be created by the user, that
defines the log likelihood of the logit model used for \code{robust} variance
estimation. Generally, this will be the same function as
\code{propensity_integrand}. Indeed, this is the default.}

\item{allocations}{a vector of values in [0, 1]. Increasing the number of
elements of the allocation vector greatly increases computation time; however,
a larger number of allocations will make plots look nicer. A minimum of two
allocations is required.}

\item{data}{the analysis data frame. This must include all the variables
defined in the \code{formula}.}

\item{model_method}{the method used to estimate or set the propensity model
parameters. Must be one of \code{'glm'}, \code{'glmer'}, or \code{'oracle'}.
Defaults to \code{'glmer'}. For a fixed effects only model use \code{'glm'},
and to include random effects use\code{'glmer'}. \code{logit_integrand}
only supports a single random effect for the grouping variable, so if more
random effects are included in the model, different \code{propensity_integrand}
and \code{loglihood_integrand} functions should be defined. When the propensity
parameters are known (as in simulations) or if estimating parameters by
other methods, use the \code{'oracle'} option. See \code{model_options} for
details on how to pass the oracle parameters.}

\item{model_options}{a list of options passed to the function in
\code{model_method}. Defaults to \code{list(family = binomial(link = 'logit'))}.
When \code{model_method = 'oracle'}, the list must have two elements
\code{fixed.effects} and \code{random.effects}. If the model did not include
random effects, set \code{random.effects = NULL}.}

\item{causal_estimation_method}{currently only supports \code{'ipw'}.}

\item{causal_estimation_options}{A list with two slots. (1) \code{variance_estimation} is
either \code{'naive'} or \code{'robust'}. See details. Defaults to \code{'robust'}. (2)
is \code{set_NA_to_0}. Defaults to \code{TRUE}. When, for example, group sizes
reach over 1000, the product terms of the propensity diminish to zero.
This may result in \code{NaN} values for the weights or loglihood. This option
sets such cases to zero.}

\item{conf.level}{level for confidence intervals. Defaults to \code{0.95}.}

\item{rescale.factor}{a scalar multiplication factor by which to rescale outcomes
and effects. Defaults to \code{1}.}

\item{...}{Used to pass additional arguments to internal functions such as
\code{numDeriv::grad()} or \code{integrate()}. Additionally, arguments can be
passed to the \code{propensity_integrand} and \code{loglihood_integrand} functions.}
}
\value{
Returns a list of overall and group-level IPW point estimates, overall
and group-level IPW point estimates (using the weight derivatives), derivatives
of the loglihood, the computed weight matrix, the computed
weight derivative array, and a summary.
}
\description{
Estimate Causal Effects in presence of interference
}
\details{
The following formula includes a random effect for the group: \code{outcome |
exposure ~ propensity covariates + (1|group) | group}. In this instance, the
group variable appears twice. If the study design includes a "participation"
variable, this is easily added to the formula: \code{outcome | exposure |
participation ~ propensity covariates | group}.

\code{logit_integrand} has two options that can be passed via the \code{...}
argument:
\itemize{
 \item \code{randomization}: a scalar. This is the \eqn{r} in the formula just
 above. It defaults to 1 in the case that a \code{participation} vector is not
 included. The vaccine study example demonstrates use of this argument.
 \item \code{integrate_allocation}: \code{TRUE/FALSE}. When group sizes grow
 large (over 1000), the product term of \code{logit_integrand} tends quickly to 0.
 When set to \code{TRUE}, the IP weights tend less quickly to 0.
 Defaults to \code{FALSE}.
}

If the true propensity model is known (e.g. in simulations) use
\code{variance_estimatation = 'naive'}; otherwise, use the default
\code{variance_estimatation = 'robust'}. Refer to the web appendix of
\href{http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/biom.12184}{Heydrich-Perez et al. (2014)}
for complete details.
